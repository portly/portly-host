Portly Router
=============

Zero-config plugin for using Wordpress and Portly together.

Install portly-router into your Wordpress `/wp-content/plugins` folder and activate.  No other configuration is needed.

You'll be able to access your Wordpress server locally or via your Portly URL without additional configuration.  No need to set up VirtualHosts either.
